        In this map the states are coloured on a scale depending on the population size. The colors have been picked
        from a light tints to resemble a lower population sizes to darker tints, to resemble higher population sizes.
        When hovered, the state, along with other features is highlighted in yellow, making it more distinct from the
        other countries.
        The background is picked to give this map a bit more of a patriotish feeling, very important since it is
        a map of America. To increase the patriotic feeling, in the CSS file a part can me uncomment to change the background
        into a fancy Gif.
        The overall lightblue background is calming and keeps the focus at the map.
        Hyperlink above on the right can be used to go to either the source of the data or to reach a page for additional State info.
